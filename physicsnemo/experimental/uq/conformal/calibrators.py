r"""Calibrators that turn held-out model errors into conformal intervals.

Choose a calibrator by the guarantee you need:

- :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.CellwiseCalibrator`: an
  interval for each output element, when every sample uses the same mesh.
- :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.FunctionalBandCalibrator`:
  one band that contains a whole field at once; meshes may vary.
- :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.RiskControlCalibrator`: a
  tighter band that bounds the expected fraction of points it misses;
  meshes may vary.

Pass each calibration sample to ``update``, then call ``finalize``
to get a :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.ConformalPredictor`.
Samples are plain tensors or ``TensorDict`` field containers. The first
sample fixes which of the two you use and which fields it has; later
samples must match. A sample that fails a check raises and leaves the
calibrator unchanged, so you can skip it and continue.

Calibration runs in the process that holds the calibrator and does not
communicate across ranks. Predictions may be computed on many GPUs, but
every calibration sample must reach the process that calls ``finalize``;
a rank that sees only part of the samples fits a threshold from that part
alone, which does not carry the stated guarantee for the full split.

The split conformal construction follows `Distribution-Free Predictive
Inference for Regression <https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04173>`_ (Lei et al.,
2018): with :math:`n_{cal}` calibration scores the fitted threshold is the
:math:`k`-th smallest score, :math:`k = \lceil (n_{cal} + 1)(1 - \alpha)
\rceil`. The conformal risk control (CRC) tier instead follows `Conformal
Risk Control <https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02814>`_ (Angelopoulos et al.,
2022).

class CellwiseCalibrator(_SplitCalibratorBase):
    r"""Calibrate a separate interval width for every output element on a fixed mesh.

    Use this calibrator when every calibration and deployment sample uses
    the same mesh or grid, with the points in the same order, and you want
    an interval for each output element, as in the field-level conformal
    prediction of `Gopakumar et al., 2024
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09881>`_. If the mesh changes between
    samples, use
    :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.FunctionalBandCalibrator`
    or :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.RiskControlCalibrator`.

    Pass the mesh coordinates as ``points=`` on every call. Two meshes count
    as the same only when their coordinate values, order, shape, and dtype
    all match; the same point count is not enough.

    Guarantee: on that fixed mesh and under exchangeability of calibration
    and test samples, every calibrated output element has marginal coverage
    :math:`\mathbb{P}(\text{lo} \le y \le \text{hi}) \ge 1 - \alpha`. Each
    element is covered on its own; the intervals are not guaranteed to
    contain the whole field at once.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score : AbsoluteErrorScore | NormalizedErrorScore | QuantileRegressionScore
        Defines the interval: ``AbsoluteErrorScore`` for a fixed-width band
        around the prediction, ``NormalizedErrorScore`` for a band scaled by
        ``aux["sigma"]``, ``QuantileRegressionScore`` to adjust the model's
        own ``aux["lo"]`` and ``aux["hi"]`` bounds. The calibrator keeps a
        copy, so later edits to ``score`` have no effect.
    alpha : float
        Target miscoverage level in :math:`(0, 1)`; ``alpha=0.1`` asks for
        90% coverage. You need :math:`n_{cal} \ge (1 - \alpha) / \alpha`
        calibration samples, for example 9 for ``alpha=0.1``.
    keys : Sequence[str], optional
        Names of the ``TensorDict`` fields to calibrate. The fitted
        :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.ConformalPredictor`
        remembers them, so its ``predict_interval`` accepts a container
        with extra fields and uses only these. By default every field is
        calibrated.

    Notes
    -----
    Each element's threshold is the :math:`k`-th smallest of its
    :math:`n_{cal}` calibration scores,
    :math:`k = \lceil (n_{cal} + 1)(1 - \alpha) \rceil`. The calibrator
    keeps every sample's scores on the CPU until :meth:`finalize`, so
    memory grows as :math:`n_{cal}` times the field size.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import torch
    >>> from physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal import (
    ...     AbsoluteErrorScore, CellwiseCalibrator,
    ... )
    >>> _ = torch.manual_seed(0)
    >>> points = torch.rand(50, 3)
    >>> calibrator = CellwiseCalibrator(AbsoluteErrorScore(), alpha=0.1)
    >>> for _ in range(20):
    ...     prediction = torch.randn(50, 2)
    ...     target = prediction + 0.1 * torch.randn(50, 2)
    ...     calibrator.update(prediction, target, points=points)
    >>> predictor = calibrator.finalize()
    >>> lo, hi = predictor.predict_interval(torch.randn(50, 2), points=points)
    >>> lo.shape
    torch.Size([50, 2])

class FunctionalBandCalibrator(_ScaledCalibratorBase):
    r"""Calibrate one band per field that contains a whole new field at once.

    Use this calibrator when a single band must cover every point of a field
    at the same time, for example to bound the worst-case error over a mesh.
    Meshes may differ between calibration and deployment. The band's
    half-width at point :math:`x` is :math:`\text{threshold} \cdot s(x)`,
    where :math:`s` is the optional difficulty field; without one the width
    is constant. Each calibration sample contributes its largest normalized
    score, :math:`\max_x \text{score}(x) / s(x)`, following the sup-norm band
    construction of `Conformal prediction bands for multivariate functional
    data <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01792>`_ (Diquigiovanni, Fontana and
    Vantini, 2021). If bounding the expected fraction of missed points is
    enough, :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.RiskControlCalibrator`
    gives tighter bands.

    Guarantee: under exchangeability of whole field samples, the band
    :math:`\text{threshold} \cdot s(x)` contains every observed point of a
    fresh field simultaneously with probability at least :math:`1 - \alpha`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score : AbsoluteErrorScore | NormalizedErrorScore | QuantileRegressionScore
        Defines the interval (see
        :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.CellwiseCalibrator`).
        The calibrator keeps a copy.
    alpha : float
        Target miscoverage level in :math:`(0, 1)`; needs
        :math:`n_{cal} \ge (1 - \alpha) / \alpha` calibration samples.
    difficulty : AuxDifficulty, optional
        Per-point positive scale :math:`s(x)` read from ``aux``, which widens
        the band where the model is less certain. Default is ``None``
        (constant width, :math:`s = 1`).
    keys : Sequence[str], optional
        Names of the ``TensorDict`` fields to calibrate (see
        :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.CellwiseCalibrator`).
        By default every field is calibrated.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``score`` already divides by the aux key that ``difficulty``
        reads, such as ``NormalizedErrorScore`` with
        ``AuxDifficulty("sigma")``, which would scale the band twice.

    Notes
    -----
    The threshold is the :math:`k`-th smallest of the :math:`n_{cal}`
    per-sample maxima, :math:`k = \lceil (n_{cal} + 1)(1 - \alpha) \rceil`.

class RiskControlCalibrator(_ScaledCalibratorBase):
    r"""Calibrate a band that bounds the expected fraction of points it misses.

    Use this calibrator when meshes vary between samples and it is enough to
    control the average fraction of points outside the band, rather than
    cover every point at once. It gives much tighter bands than
    :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.FunctionalBandCalibrator`
    in exchange for this weaker guarantee. A point counts as missed when any
    of its components (trailing dimensions) falls outside the band. Every
    sample has equal weight, whatever its point count. The threshold comes
    from conformal risk control (CRC), `Conformal Risk Control
    <https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02814>`_ (Angelopoulos, Bates, Fisch, Lei
    and Schuster, 2022).

    Guarantee: under exchangeability of whole samples, the expected
    miscovered-point fraction of a fresh sample is at most :math:`\alpha`.
    The fitted threshold :math:`\lambda` is the smallest observed score with
    :math:`(\hat R(\lambda) + 1)/(n_{cal} + 1) \le \alpha`, where
    :math:`\hat R` sums the per-sample miscovered fractions; this requires
    :math:`\alpha \ge 1 / (n_{cal} + 1)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    score : AbsoluteErrorScore | NormalizedErrorScore | QuantileRegressionScore
        Defines the interval (see
        :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.CellwiseCalibrator`).
        The calibrator keeps a copy.
    alpha : float
        Target expected fraction of missed points, in :math:`(0, 1)`.
    difficulty : AuxDifficulty, optional
        Per-point positive scale :math:`s(x)` read from ``aux``, which widens
        the band where the model is less certain. Default is ``None``
        (constant width, :math:`s = 1`).
    keys : Sequence[str], optional
        Names of the ``TensorDict`` fields to calibrate (see
        :class:`~physicsnemo.experimental.uq.conformal.CellwiseCalibrator`).
        By default every field is calibrated.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``score`` already divides by the aux key that ``difficulty``
        reads, such as ``NormalizedErrorScore`` with
        ``AuxDifficulty("sigma")``, which would scale the band twice.

    Notes
    -----
    The calibrator keeps every sample's per-point scores on the CPU until
    :meth:`finalize`, so memory grows with the total number of calibration
    points.

    --------
    >>> import torch
